# Internet of Things (Air Quality Tracking) - Java Swing Application

I made this final project for the course Application Engineering and Development which I studied in the Fall 2015 semester during my 
graduate study of Master of Science in Information Systems at Northeastern University, Boston.

# Project Description

1. Designed and developed a Java Swing application and implemented the Eco-system model at Enterprise level.
2. Implemented the Singleton design pattern for reporting and analysis of Air Pollution by measuring Air Index captured through sensors installed on
the streets in any city.
3. This data about the Air Index of a particular city can be used by the reasearchers, policy makers to take measures leading to make the 
city more livable and having an eco-friendly environment accross the streets.
4. A similar idea has already started to be implemented in Chicago known as the 'Array of Things' by the University of Chicago. The link to 
it: https://arrayofthings.github.io/
