## Air Index Calculator (Internet of Things) - Java Swing Application

### Description
* Developed an enterprise application using Java and implemented it using the Eco-System model.
* Built the application using singleton design pattern to implement the concept of user registration, user login, work requests, and work queues.
* Simulated the working of sensors to record the quantities of different pollutants in the atmosphere and calculated the air index of different regions with the help of those measurements. 
* Concluded about the quality of air in a region on the basis of the air index of that region.
* Performed visualizations of the data obtained from sensors for analysis.
