# Internet of Things (Air Quality Tracking) - Java Swing Application

This is the final project for the course Application Engineering and Development. It can be used to track air quality of different streets and cities by collection data from the sensors installed in this regions.

# Project Description

1. Designed and developed a Java Swing application and implemented the eco-system model at enterprise level.
2. Implemented the Singleton design pattern for reporting and analysis of air pollution by measuring Air Index captured through sensors installed on the streets in any city.
3. This data about the Air Index of a particular city can be used by the reasearchers, policy makers to take measures leading to make the city more livable and having an eco-friendly environment accross the streets.
4. A similar idea has already started to be implemented in Chicago known as the 'Array of Things' by the University of Chicago. The link to
